## What is submetering?
Submetering involves installing individual meters to measure the consumption of electricity, gas, or water for each tenant in a building or complex. With submetering, each tenant is responsible for their individual usage, and billing is based on actual consumption, promoting fairness and transparency. Additionally, submetering can incentivize tenants to conserve resources and reduce waste, leading to cost savings for both you and your tenants.

## What is an electricity sub-meter?
An electricity subsidiary meter (sub-meter) is a meter that allows for the monitoring of electricity usage on a portion of your private installation past the revenue meter. Typical users of sub-metering are residential properties with a granny flat, apartment buildings, shopping centres, mobile home parks and commercial buildings.

The revenue meter records the total consumption and the electric sub-meter records the part consumption for the sub-metered area only. Thus, the sub-meter’s consumption is recorded in the revenue meter.
